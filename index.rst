My Experience
-------------

A few weeks ago, I needed to check my Home Depot credit card balance before making a big purchase. I went to homedepot.com/mycard, entered my login details, and hit "Sign In"‚Äîbut nothing happened. The page just refreshed with no error message. I tried again, thinking I mistyped my password, but it still didn‚Äôt work.

At first, I thought the site was down, but after some trial and error, I realized the issue was on my end. I cleared my browser cache, restarted the browser, and switched from Safari to Chrome. That finally did the trick. It was a browser-related issue causing the login page to glitch. Since then, I‚Äôve bookmarked the site and always keep my browser updated‚Äîno more problems since!
